Java Web Start (a Sun trademark) is a convenient way to start Java applications from the Net. The application archives are kept in a local cache and will be used in off-line mode. Java Web Start automatically looks for updates of the application, so updating is no longer a problem.
</p>

<p>
You will need at least Java 1.2 to use Java Web Start. Supported operating systems are all flavors of Windows, Linux and Sun's Sparc. <font color="#d97d49"><b>Hilbert II</b></font> needs at least Java 1.4.
</p>

<p>
Follow the following steps.
<ul>
<li>Java Web Start is included in Java 1.4. If you have no Java version or you are using an earlier version, download and install Java Web Start from <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/index_download.jsp"> Sun's page</a>, if necessary. </li>
<li>Then click on <a href="http://www.qedeq.org/0_00_53/pmii.jnlp">pmii 0.00.53</a>. There should be a splash screen for Java Web Start, asking you to trust the signature. Although it will be not recommended you must trust the signature of <font color="#d97d49"><b>Hilbert II</b></font> to start the application.</li>
<li>If you want to use the program off-line, you may now use a link to Java Web Start directly. Java Web Start can also install an icon on the desktop for you.</li>
</ul>
