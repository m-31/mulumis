This project deals with different simulations of star movements and their visualizations. At first we look at the projection and accumulation of star brightness. In actually doing this we have to distribute stars among a three dimensional figure. To get a nice effect we combine the photographic image production with a moving view point. So we get the visual impression of flying through a star field.

Secondly we will study different algorithms of particle movements and clustering. The primary approach will use a combination of Newton's gravitational law, energy and impulse conservation.

At all these stages an highly dynamic view of the processes could be produced and will lead at least to interesting screen savers...
