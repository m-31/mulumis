This project deals with different simulations of star movements and
their visualizations.
</p>
<p>
First issue is the projection and accumulation of star brightness.
In actually doing this we distribute stars among a three dimensional
sphere.
</p>
<p>
To get a nice effect we combine the photographic image production with
a moving view point. So we get the visual impression of flying through
a star field.
</p>
<p>
Second issue are modeling of particle movements and clustering.
The primary approach will use a combination of newton's gravitational
law, energy and impulse conservation.
