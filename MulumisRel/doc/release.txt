This is a release of the program suite "Simulum". Simulum deals with
different simulations of star movements and their visualizations.

A huge refactoring phase took place. Now the code is much better
organized.

Now a simple gravity engine is included, so you can watch gravity at
work. Look how the stars are pulled to the center and how some of
same esacape the herd.

Last but not least it has now a nice GUI. You can browse the 
simulation as you like it just with your mouse.

The provided unsigned jar includes an applet that can directly be 
used by html pages. This release includes sample html pages.
You can also webstart the signed jar or start it with 
"java -jar lib/mulumis.jar". Perhaps even a simple double click 
kicks off the application.

The java screen saver was not updated. You have to load the old
0.00.03 version.
